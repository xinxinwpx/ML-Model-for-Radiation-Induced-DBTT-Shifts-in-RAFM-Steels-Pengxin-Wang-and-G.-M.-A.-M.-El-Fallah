# A Data-Driven Machine Learning Model for Radiation-Induced DBTT Shifts in RAFM Steels

## Authors

Pengxin Wang, G. M. A. M. El-Fallah

## Overview

This repository contains the complete machine learning workflow for predicting radiation-induced ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) shifts in Reduced Activation Ferritic-Martensitic (RAFM) steels. A stacking ensemble model was built by integrating XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The model leverages alloy composition and irradiation conditions to estimate DBTT variations, contributing to the understanding of radiation effects in structural materials.

## Contents

- ðŸ“Š **Dataset**  
  The processed Excel dataset containing alloy compositions, irradiation conditions, and DBTT values.

- ðŸ§  **Independent training of XGBoost, RF, GBDT, and MLP**  
  Scripts for individual training of the four base models, including hyperparameter optimisation using Optuna.

- ðŸ”€ **Stacking of XGBoost, RF, GBDT, and MLP (with tuning)**  
  Code for constructing and training the stacking ensemble with Ridge as the meta-learner.

- ðŸ“ˆ **Feature Importance Analysis of the Stacking Model**  
  Weighted feature importance analysis based on each model's RÂ² contribution, including permutation importance for MLP.

- ðŸ§© **SHAP Analysis of the Stacking Model**  
  SHAP-based visualisation and interaction analysis of feature contributions, including SHAP interaction matrix and dependence plots.
